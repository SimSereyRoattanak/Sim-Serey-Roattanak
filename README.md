# Sim-Serey-Roattanak


My name is Roattanak. I joined unity game development club in order to understand how to make games. Even though I have prior experience on game development, I want to understand more on the ever-increasing features of Unity and to create a game that will captivate the player. I want to make a game that is fun and engaging to the player. After creating a single player game I want to make it multiplayer.
